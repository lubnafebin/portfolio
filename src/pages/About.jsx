      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I am an enthusiastic and creative Frontend Developer, 
      weaving my tech story from a small village with big dreams. 
      My journey into the world of technology began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA), 
      where I discovered my passion for building user-friendly web interfaces and experiences.
      Along the way, I’ve worked on several projects that helped shape my skills — including EmpowerNet, a full-stack application built with React, Node.js, and MySQL to digitize Self-Help Group management. 
      These hands-on experiences not only strengthened my coding abilities but also sparked my interest in UI/UX design and user-centered development.
